To create a README for your Facial Recognition Application, could you clarify a few details?

What is the main purpose or use case for this project? (e.g., attendance system, security, demo, etc.)
What libraries, frameworks, or models are used?
Any installation or setup instructions you want included?
Do you have sample input/output or screenshots?
Are there any notable features or limitations?
With your answers, I can generate a more tailored README. If you want a general template, let me know!

Facial Recognition Application

A Python-based application for facial recognition using classical and deep learning models. This project leverages the face_recognition library to train on known faces, validate model accuracy, and test images for identification.

Features

Train on Known Faces: Encode facial features from images in the training/ directory.
Validation: Automatically tests all images in validation/ to assess recognition accuracy.
Face Recognition: Recognizes faces in user-specified images and displays results.
Model Selection: Supports "hog" (CPU, faster, less accurate) and "cnn" (GPU, slower, more accurate) models.
Simple CLI: Command-line arguments for training, validating, and testing.
Directory Structure

training/: Place subfolders named after each person, filled with their images for training.
validation/: Place images to evaluate recognition performance.
output/encodings.pkl: Stores serialized facial encodings.
detector.py: Main script for training, validation, and recognition.
Requirements

See Requirements.txt:

Code
dlib-bin==19.24.6
face-recognition==1.3.0 --no-deps
face-recognition-models==0.3.0
click==8.2.1
numpy==1.24.2
Pillow==9.4.0
Setup

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
Prepare training/validation images:

Organize images in training/person_name/ and validation/.
Usage:

Train:
bash
python detector.py --train
Validate:
bash
python detector.py --validate
Test:
bash
python detector.py --test -f path/to/test_image.jpg
Model selection:
Add -m cnn for GPU-based deep learning.
How It Works

Trains on labeled images, encoding facial features.
Validates recognition by running on a separate set of images.
Draws bounding boxes and labels on detected faces in test images.
Notes

Requires Python 3.10+.
For best results, use clear, high-resolution images.
GPU (with CUDA) recommended for "cnn" mode.
